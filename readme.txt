A small plugin to create changelog entries related to a custom post type.

== Description ==

Each changelog post is assigned to a Project taxonomy and displayed on a page with the same name/slug. You can change which post type the changelogs are associated with on the plugin's Settings page.

== Installation ==

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I change the "Changelog" heading? =

Navigate to the Changelogs > Settings page and enter a new value for the heading.

= What if I want the Changelog posts to be attached to a different post type, not pages? =

On the Changelogs > Settings page, you can assign the changelog posts to any registered post type.

= Um. My changelog posts are not showing up on the page/post/whatever I've selected. =

Please make sure that the slug (not the name) of the Project matches the slug of the page to which you want it associated.
